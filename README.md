# Weather-Dashboard

Deployed app: https://lnguyen95uzi.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

Project Description:

This app, with the help of OpenWeather API, helps the user search by city name and receives current weather conditions for that city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, and an icon that represents the current weather (sunny, cloudy, rain, snow,...). Along with the current day, a 5-day forecast is also provided for said city providing the temperature and humidity. 

As the user clicks to search a city, that city is saved in local storage and shown under the search box. 

Challenges:
Many challenges were encountered along the way. Javascript is still hard to reformat to get right. Issues with building local storage and ajax/api system.
